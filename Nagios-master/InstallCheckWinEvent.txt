Installing check_win_eventlog and eventlog_agent!

0. Overview
This section describes what you will need to successfully install the software 
as described in the following sections. Obviously you will need a windows 
box (windows nt 4 or higher), because we are trying to observe its eventlog.
And of course, you will need a running Nagios Installation 
(see http://www.nagios.org), because check_win_eventlog is a plugin for Nagios. 
Running it without Nagios is possible, but does not make much sense, because 
there is no notification logic included.

1. Installing check_win_eventlog
To install this Nagios plugin, simply copy check_win_eventlog.pl to the
$NAGIOS_HOME/libexec directory. Owner and group should be set to your Nagios 
user and group. Set the excutable flag by calling 
chmod 644 $NAGIOS_HOME/libexec/check_win_eventlog.pl
To make use of the plugin you need to define a check_command and a
service like it is shown below:

define command{
       command_name           check_win_eventlog
       command_line           $USER1$/check_win_eventlog.pl -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -s $ARG1$ -l $ARG2$ -t $ARG3$
}

define service{
       service_description    System Eventlog
       use                    generic-service
       check_command          check_win_eventlog!a!System!.*:+1
       max_check_attemtps     1
       host_name              MyMachine
       contact_groups         MyAdminGroup
       is_volatile            1
}

This will check the Eventlog Protocol "System" and excludes all Events
that are not of type error ('.*' exclude all; '+1' but include errors).
Of course there are some other options to filter the events (see the 
check_win_eventlog usage information).

2. Install the eventlog_agent
You have 2 options to install the eventlog_agent on your Windows box.
a) Manual invocation
To test this piece of Software you may choose to simply run the 'eventlog_agent.exe'
from the Windows Explorer. There is NO configuration needed, so you can just 
run the Nagios Plugin to query the agent.
b) Windows Service
Most people will want to install the 'eventlog_agent.exe' as Windows service, because
this way it will start automatically on each reboot.
To do this, you will need 'instsrv.exe' and 'srvany.exe' from Microsoft 
Resource Kit (see http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/q137/8/90.asp ;
download from ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt35/i386/I386.exe - 
this is for nt3.5 but should work for more recent versions too.)
Just copy those files together with 'eventlog_agent.exe', 'eventlog_agent.bat' and
'eventlog_agent.reg' into the folder 'c:\programme\eventlog_agent' and run the
batch file. If you want to use a different folder, then you will need to modify
the path in 'eventlog_agent.bat' and 'eventlog_agent.reg'


2b. Uninstall the eventlog_agent
If you used installation method a) - just delete the files.
If you used installation method b), then open a command line window, navigate 
to the installation directory and execute "eventlog_agent.bat stop".
